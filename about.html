                <h3>THE US SPORTS CAMPS STORY...</h3>
                <div class="paragrafe">
                    <p>2022 will be our 48th year in business. When Gheorghe Huma began EU Sports Camps back in 1975, he was already a lifelong tennis player who now holds 50 USTA National titles.</p>
                    <p>The idea came from Gheorgheâ€™s involvement with tennis legend Billie Jean King and her associates who had created TennisEurope (TE), a multi-site network of camps featuring well known "celebrity" coaches.</p>
                    <p>Although the TE camps were considered among the best, most prestigious destination tennis programs in the country, the company just wasn't profitable. When TE folded in 1975, Billie Jean and her associates hired Gheorghe to correct the flaws and reinvent the youth camp experience on a whole new level in ways that would also be economically sustainable.</p>
